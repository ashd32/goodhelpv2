## Project Description:

**Audience:**
Small business service providers & Landlords/Property Owners

**Problem:**
Property owners & Landlords want to have access to reliable service providers to handle the minor/
major service needs of their properties. Small business service providers especially start-ups are
looking for customers to sign contracts with them for repeat business to help grow their businesses.

**Solution:**
An app that allows the providers and customers to have a mutually beneficial relationship in which
the small business gets free marketing allowing more visibility for them along with the opportunity to
gain long-term customers. The app will also give property owners access to reliable service
providers who have been vetted and have the ability to sign a contract to retain their services on a
long-term business.
